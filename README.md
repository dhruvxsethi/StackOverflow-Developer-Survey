# StackOverflow-Developer-Survey
Used Python &amp; its libraries to survey the StackOverflow Developer Dataset

## Data Driven Approach Using Survey Data

This repository contains the results of a study conducted to better understand the job satisfaction of full-time developers aged 15 to 60.

## Data
The data used is the [Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) collected by Stackoverflow for the year 2020 . It contains responses of nearly 65K participants from over 150 countries. According to Stack overflow, the survey was conducted in February 2020, before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.
 
## Pre-requisites
The project was developed using python 3 with the following packages.
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files
- data/ : Folder with dataset, schema , readme file of stack overflow, stack overflow survey details
- Data Analysis - StackOverflow Survey.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook with all the exploratory analysis and findings

## Summary
The analysis is a basic EDA to understand what the dataset portrays.

1. This survey represents the overall programming community
2. Has a fewer responses from non English speaking countries/ women & non binary genders
3. We should make an effort to encourage these underrepresented communities
4. Although most respondants have a degree, it isnt necessary to build a career in programming
5. We can start programming by working on it as a freelancer or part time, as seen by a significant portion of the community
6. HTML/CSS/JS are most used followed by Python/SQL
7. Python is most interseting language to learn - it is easy to learn and can be applied in various domains
8. Rust & TypeScript are most loved, followed by Python(which is already a widely used language)
9. Programmers work for around 40 hours, slight variations by country
10. Can start learning Programming at any age, can also enjoy it as a hobby
